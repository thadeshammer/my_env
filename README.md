# My personal environments

So I can easily port this stuff between rigs. (You do this too, right?)

I've moved on to `nvim` so the VSCode specific elements are all out of date.

## systems

- robot-unicorn-attack
  - windows 11
    - wsl (Ubuntu 24 LTS) 
    - windows-terminal specific config
  - ubuntu studio 24
    - not represented
  - cachyos
    - pending

- xps-13-9305
  - archlinux
  - windows 10
    - formatted

- mbp-i7
  - pretty close to WSL config with mac specific variation
